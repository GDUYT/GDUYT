  Yesterday night, I just had a magic idea. As a coder, i usually do some Android system customization work. And i am a gamer too.
  
  So, i think it will be fantastic that A operation system made of games. it sounds crazy! right?！！But think about it, if the terminal command line is composed of ancient Chinese poems. You Know, the command will be idiom, the parameter will be the rhyming word that to ends a line of verse. Maby, i will creat a new pramgram language wihch made of The Chinese characters components. The next step, i can develop a complier named "cihai" what compiling this new pramgram language.
  
  Clicking on the program on the graphical desktop will turn the action into a shooting scene in an FPS game. Soldier, if you shoot the enemy in the head. congratulations , you've unlocked the screensaver. The byte units of memory can be organized like Tetris. The data bus and the address bus will be the two tracks used to race. Storage disks will become pixel worlds for you to build and parse. The competition between threads for resources becomes a tower defense game of siege. The Progress managing becomes a MOBA game of killing and pillaging each other. 
  
  …………
  
  fuck the common sense! Just let your mind soar. The rule here is no rules! 
  
  If someone feels that this system has no use value and no business value, then my goal has been achieved. Before i do most things in my life, I thought about whether they are meaningful or useful. This allows me to focus on more important and meaningful things and be more productive. But not doing something that seemed pointless, useless, or even boring, made me miss out on something wonderful. So, no matter it is useful or useless, Just do it.
  
  But even creating such a useless system is complicated and difficult. It requires a great deal of computer knowledge ,skill and a great deal of programming. I know it need a lot of time to do such a complex work. So I will take this as my life goal to accomplish it. If you have to find any meaning in doing this thing, then the process of doing this thing itself will be its greatest meaning. Because in this process, need to keep thinking, keep learning. I enjoy the process of constantly thinking and trying my best to accomplish something I love.
  
  Finally, I would be very grateful if someone has better suggestions and thoughts to tell me about this matter. thanks!
